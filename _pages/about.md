<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an undergraduate student at Wuhan University, advised by [Prof. Xue Yang](https://xueyang.github.io/). 
I have published papers at top-tier international CV conferences and journals such as **CVPR** and **IJCV**. I am always open to academic collaboration—feel free to reach out to me at **peiyuanzhangwhu@whu.edu.cn**.

My research interests include Deep Learning and Computer Vision, with a focus on Generic/Oriented Object Detection, Vision-Language Models, Remote Sensing/Aerial Image Interpretation.
