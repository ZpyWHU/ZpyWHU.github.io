<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an undergraduate student at Wuhan University, advised by [Prof. Xue Yang](https://yangxue.site/). 
I have published papers at top-tier international CV conferences and journals such as **CVPR** and **IJCV**. I am always open to academic collaboration—feel free to reach out to me at **peiyuanzhangwhu@whu.edu.cn**.

My research interests include Deep Learning and Computer Vision, with a focus on Generic/Oriented Object Detection, Vision-Language Models, Remote Sensing/Aerial Image Interpretation.

[Point2RBox-v2: Rethinking Point-supervised Oriented Object Detection with Spatial Layout Among Instances](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04268)

**Yi Yu**, **Botao Ren**, **Peiyuan Zhang**, Mingxin Liu, Junwei Luo, Shaofeng Zhang, Feipeng Da, Junchi Yan, Xue Yang

[**Project**](https://github.com/VisionXLab/point2rbox-v2) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='rQbW67AAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC'></span></strong>
- Rethinking point-supervised oriented object detection with the layout among instances. At the core are three principles: 1) Gaussian overlap loss. 2) Voronoi watershed loss. 3) Consistency loss.

[Envisioning Beyond the Pixels: Benchmarking Reasoning-Informed Visual Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02826)

**Xiangyu Zhao**, **Peiyuan Zhang**, **Kexian Tang**, Xiaorong Zhu, Hao Li, Wenhao Chai, Zicheng Zhang, Renqiu Xia, Guangtao Zhai, Junchi Yan, Hua Yang, Xue Yang, Haodong Duan

[**Project**](https://github.com/PhoenixZ810/RISEBench) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='rQbW67AAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C'></span></strong>
- We propose RISEBench, the first benchmark for reasoning-informed visual editing, covering four core reasoning tasks—Temporal, Causal, Spatial, and Logical—and introducing a comprehensive evaluation framework with three key dimensions: Instruction Reasoning, Appearance Consistency, and Visual Plausibility.
